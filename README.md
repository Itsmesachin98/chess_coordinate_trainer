## 🧠 How It Works
1. When you start training, a random coordinate (e.g., **e4**) appears on the board.
2. Your goal: **Click the corresponding square** as fast as possible.
3. Every correct click earns you a point, and a new coordinate appears.
4. The timer keeps running — try to rack up the highest score before resetting!

## 💡 Future Improvements
- 🔥 Sound effects and animations for correct/incorrect clicks
- 📊 Leaderboard to track high scores
- 🎧 Dark mode toggle
- ♟️ Piece-specific coordinate training (e.g., knight jumps)
